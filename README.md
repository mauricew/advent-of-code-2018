Advent of Code 2018
==============

Getting it done in multiple languages.

## Rules
* New language every day
* Standard library only, no external packages
* Different dialects on same runtime are allowed (e.g. Java to Kotlin, C# to F#, etc.)
* Refactoring after the fact is encouraged

## Stretch Goal
Do at least three languages for each day (after the fact) with at least two outside of a *Week 1* language.

## Schedule
Subject to change.

**Week 1** is the easy stuff  
**Week 2** is non-functional stuff I haven't really learned  
**Week 3** is functional week  
**Week 4** is grab bag 

|Day|Language|

|Day 1|[Java](day_1)|
|Day 2|[Python](day_2)|
|Day 3|[C#](day_3)|
|Day 4|[Ruby](day_4)|
